# MP3 Task

This is an old coding task for a Job Interview a few years ago. It was the following task:

> The task is to open an MP3 file and output some data on that file. We've split this into a couple of stages, a basic starter set and a more advanced set
> ### Basic file information
> As a starter, print basic information on the file, this can include:
> * File size
> * Timestamps
> * File flags (read only status)
> * Any other helpful information about the file
> ### MP3 data analysis
> For the more advanced information, you should calculate the number of frames, the sample rate and average bitrate for the audio contained in the file.
> * Your solution should handle constant bitrate (CBR) MP3s.
> * Your solution should handle variable bitrate (VBR) MP3s.
> * You should not parse ID3v1/ID3v2 structures (although you can if you want to) but you will need to ensure you do not accidentally interpret these as part of the MP3.
> * We have provided bitrates for MPEG 1 Layer III (you may see files in other formats; for the purposes of this task we are only looking at MPEG 1 Layer III).
> * Your solution should be concise. Keep it simple!
